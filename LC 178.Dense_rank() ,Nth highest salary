dense_rank like its give rank in like , higher value have rank 1 and so on.....
100
200
400
400
200
100

for that dense_rank() will give 
400 1
400 1
200 2
200 2
100 3
100 3

its handel the duplicacy even its come two time its have same rank.

select e_salary ,DENSE_RANK() over( order by e_salary desc) as salry_rank from employee
190989	1
190989	1
14909	2
12309	3
12309	3
12309	3
10909	4
1130	5
1130	5
1130	5
1100	6

duplicate naa aaye
select DISTINCT(e_salary) ,DENSE_RANK() over( order by e_salary desc) as salry_rank from employee;
190989	1
14909	  2
12309	  3
10909	  4
1130	  5
1100	  6

I want second highest or Nth highest 
SELECT e_salary from ( select DISTINCT(e_salary) ,DENSE_RANK() over( order by e_salary desc) as salary_rank from employee) p where salary_rank=2
p is the alias it can be any thing you want ,but dont forgot to put that otherwise syntax error you will face.

if nth highest then put salary_rank= N thats it


1-
select max(e_salary) as second_highest from employee where e_salary <(select max(e_salary) from employee );

2-
select distinct e_salary as secondhighestsalary from employee order by e_salary desc limit 1 Offset 1;

3-
Select IFNULL((select distinct e_salary as secondhighestsalary from employee order by e_salary desc limit 1 Offset 1
),NULL) as secondhighestsalary;




Leetcode 178 define the rank over the score

select score ,Dense_rank() over (order by score desc) as "rank" from scores;

yaha alias me direct rank nahi likh sakte because its a function in sql but in o/p they want it as Rank colomn that why we need to "" for that alias
4- DENCE_RANK  
select salary from ( select distinct salary ,dense_rank() over(order by salary desc ) as salary_rank from employee) a where salary_rank =2;
 but ye upar wala null wale case ko handel nahi kar payega so IFNULL use karna padega



select IFNULL(
  (select salary as SecondHighestSalary 
from (select salary ,dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as salary_rank from employee) a
where salary_rank = 2),NULL
) as secondhighestsalary
