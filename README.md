# The data warehouse migration architecture
 # project onprem to gcs cloud ( big query)

 # --------- # Explanation  

 Approach to migrating an on-premises data warehouse to Google Cloud's BigQuery. Here's a breakdown of the key components and steps involved:

**Source data:**

* On-prem data warehouse: This represents your existing data warehouse system, which could be based on various technologies like Teradata, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server.

**Cloud migration tools:**

* **Cloud Storage:** This acts as a landing zone for your on-premises data files.
* **Dataflow:** A serverless data processing service that can be used to transform and prepare your data for loading into BigQuery.
* **Transfer Appliance (optional):** A physical device that can be used for high-speed data transfer between your on-premises environment and Google Cloud.
* **Cloud SQL:** A managed relational database service that can be used to store historical data for auditing purposes.
* **Pelican GKE Cluster:** An optional component that can be used for data quality checks and transformations that require more complex logic.

**Target data warehouse:**

* **BigQuery:** Google's serverless, cloud-based data warehouse designed for large-scale data analytics.

**Steps involved:**

1. **Schema and data modeling:** Analyze your existing data warehouse schema and identify opportunities for optimization in the cloud environment. This may involve denormalizing data for faster query performance or conforming to BigQuery's best practices.
2. **Data transfer:**
    * **Full load:** Use Dataflow or Transfer Appliance to migrate historical data from your on-premises warehouse to Cloud Storage.
    * **Incremental updates:** Establish scheduled tasks using Cloud Composer to continuously transfer new and updated data from your on-premises warehouse to Cloud Storage. Dataflow can then be used to process and transform this data before loading it into BigQuery.
3. **Data transformation:** Use Dataflow or your chosen transformation tool to clean, format, and enrich your data as needed before loading it into BigQuery. This may involve tasks like:
    * **Data validation:** Ensuring data adheres to quality standards and business rules.
    * **Data conversion:** Converting data types and formats to match BigQuery's requirements.
    * **Data partitioning:** Organizing data into logical units for improved query performance.
4. **Data loading:** Use tools like `bq load` or Cloud Storage integration to load your transformed data into BigQuery.
5. **Testing and validation:** Thoroughly test your migrated data and ensure data quality, consistency, and accuracy.
6. **Go live:** Cut over your users and applications to the new BigQuery data warehouse.

**Additional notes:**

* This is a simplified overview, and the specific tools and steps involved may vary depending on your specific requirements and data volumes.
* Security and access control are essential considerations throughout the migration process.
* The diagram also mentions Shared Services, IAM, Security, Cloud Build, Source/Terraform Repo, Cloud DNS, Cloud Operations Suite, Partner Interconnect, etc., which are essential background services that support the core data migration functionalities but aren't directly involved in the data transferring and transformation steps.

Sure, here is a more detailed explanation of each step in the data engineering / science and analytics process depicted in the image, along with some example code snippets where applicable:


**Step 1: Recruiting data experts from health care providers**

* **Goal:** This step involves identifying and hiring data scientists and engineers with expertise in the healthcare domain. 
* **Considerations:** 
    * Look for candidates with experience working with healthcare data, including familiarity with relevant regulations and compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA).
    * Assess the candidate's technical skills in areas like data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing.
    * Evaluate the candidate's ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
* **Example code:** N/A (This step involves recruiting personnel and doesn't directly translate to code.)


**Step 2: Data Ingest**

* **Goal:** This step involves collecting and transferring data from various healthcare provider sources into Google Cloud.
* **Considerations:** 
    * Identify the relevant data sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), claims data, and patient registries.
    * Choose appropriate data transfer methods based on the volume, frequency, and sensitivity of the data. 
    * Ensure data security and compliance throughout the transfer process.
* **Example code:**

```python
# Using Cloud Dataflow to stream data from an EHR system
from apache_beam.io import ReadFromText
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions
from apache_beam.io.gcp.bigquery import WriteToBigQuery

# Define pipeline options
opts = PipelineOptions(
    runner='DataflowRunner',
    project='your-project-id',
    region='your-region'
)

# Read data from EHR system
p = beam.Pipeline(options=opts)
lines = p | 'ReadFromText' >> ReadFromText('gs://your-bucket/ehr_data.txt')

# Write data to BigQuery
lines | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> WriteToBigQuery(
    table='your-project.your_dataset.ehr_data',
    schema='patient_id:STRING,timestamp:TIMESTAMP,diagnosis:STRING,...'
)

# Run the pipeline
p.run()
```


**Step 3: Data Storage**

* **Goal:** This step involves storing the transferred data in a secure and scalable data store in Google Cloud.
* **Considerations:** 
    * Choose a storage solution that aligns with your data access patterns, compliance requirements, and budget.
    * Google Cloud offers various storage options, such as Cloud Storage for flexible object storage, BigQuery for large-scale data warehousing, and Cloud SQL for relational databases.
* **Example code:** N/A (This step involves data storage configuration and doesn't directly translate to code.)


**Step 4: Data Preprocessing**

* **Goal:** This step involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
* **Considerations:** 
    * Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
    * Transform data into a format suitable for analysis, such as encoding categorical variables or creating new features.
    * Consider using tools like Google Cloud Dataproc or Cloud Dataflow for distributed data processing.
* **Example code:**

```python
# Using Cloud Dataproc to preprocess EHR data
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('EHRPreprocessing').getOrCreate()

# Load data from BigQuery
df = spark.read.bigquery('your-project.your_dataset.ehr_data')

# Handle missing values
df = df.fillna({'diagnosis': 'unknown'})

# Create new features
df['age_group'] = spark.udf(lambda dob: 'adult' if int(dob[:4]) < 1980 else 'pediatric')(df['date_of_birth'])

# Write preprocessed data back to BigQuery
df.write.bigquery('your-project.your_dataset.preprocessed_ehr_data')

# Stop SparkSession
spark.stop()
```


**Step 5: Data Modeling**

* **Goal:** This step involves defining the structure and relationships between different data elements to support efficient querying and analysis.
* **Considerations:** 
    * Choose a data model that aligns with your analytical needs and query patterns.
    * Star schema and snowflake schema are common data models for data warehousing.
* **Example code:** N/A (This step involves data schema design and doesn't directly translate to code.)


**Step 6: Data Exploration and Analysis**

* **Goal:** This step involves exploring and analyzing the data to extract insights and identify patterns.
