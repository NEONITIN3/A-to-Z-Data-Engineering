# The data warehouse migration architecture
 # project onprem to gcs cloud ( big query)

 # --------- # Explanation  

 Approach to migrating an on-premises data warehouse to Google Cloud's BigQuery. Here's a breakdown of the key components and steps involved:

**Source data:**

* On-prem data warehouse: This represents your existing data warehouse system, which could be based on various technologies like Teradata, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server.

**Cloud migration tools:**

* **Cloud Storage:** This acts as a landing zone for your on-premises data files.
* **Dataflow:** A serverless data processing service that can be used to transform and prepare your data for loading into BigQuery.
* **Transfer Appliance (optional):** A physical device that can be used for high-speed data transfer between your on-premises environment and Google Cloud.
* **Cloud SQL:** A managed relational database service that can be used to store historical data for auditing purposes.
* **Pelican GKE Cluster:** An optional component that can be used for data quality checks and transformations that require more complex logic.

**Target data warehouse:**

* **BigQuery:** Google's serverless, cloud-based data warehouse designed for large-scale data analytics.

**Steps involved:**

1. **Schema and data modeling:** Analyze your existing data warehouse schema and identify opportunities for optimization in the cloud environment. This may involve denormalizing data for faster query performance or conforming to BigQuery's best practices.
2. **Data transfer:**
    * **Full load:** Use Dataflow or Transfer Appliance to migrate historical data from your on-premises warehouse to Cloud Storage.
    * **Incremental updates:** Establish scheduled tasks using Cloud Composer to continuously transfer new and updated data from your on-premises warehouse to Cloud Storage. Dataflow can then be used to process and transform this data before loading it into BigQuery.
3. **Data transformation:** Use Dataflow or your chosen transformation tool to clean, format, and enrich your data as needed before loading it into BigQuery. This may involve tasks like:
    * **Data validation:** Ensuring data adheres to quality standards and business rules.
    * **Data conversion:** Converting data types and formats to match BigQuery's requirements.
    * **Data partitioning:** Organizing data into logical units for improved query performance.
4. **Data loading:** Use tools like `bq load` or Cloud Storage integration to load your transformed data into BigQuery.
5. **Testing and validation:** Thoroughly test your migrated data and ensure data quality, consistency, and accuracy.
6. **Go live:** Cut over your users and applications to the new BigQuery data warehouse.

**Additional notes:**

* This is a simplified overview, and the specific tools and steps involved may vary depending on your specific requirements and data volumes.
* Security and access control are essential considerations throughout the migration process.
* The diagram also mentions Shared Services, IAM, Security, Cloud Build, Source/Terraform Repo, Cloud DNS, Cloud Operations Suite, Partner Interconnect, etc., which are essential background services that support the core data migration functionalities but aren't directly involved in the data transferring and transformation steps.
