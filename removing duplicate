( SELECT age from persons group by age HAVING count(age)>1)	Error Code: 1093.
 You can't specify target table 'persons' for update in FROM clause	0.000 sec
 select * from product;

correct query will be like :

create a tem table with CTE 
-----------------------------------------
WITH cte as (
select name from employee group by name having count(name)>1
)delete from employee where age in (select age from cte)


IT MIGHT BE SAY SAFE MODE ERROR THEN JUST DISABLE IT :    --> SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

AFTER EXECITING ENABLE IT --->  SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
---------------------------------------------------
window function se bhi 

WITH CTE as (
select * , row_number() over(partition by colomn,order by colom2) as r from table
)
delete from cte where r>1;
