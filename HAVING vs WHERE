when we need to perform condition on group of row then we used HAVING.

Key Differences Between WHERE and HAVING Clause 
Here are the key differences between WHERE and HAVING clause in SQL:

The WHERE clause implements in row operations, whereas the HAVING clause implements in column operations.
The HAVING clause can contain an aggregate function, but the WHERE clause cannot contain an aggregate function.
You can use the WHERE clause with a single row function. Whereas the HAVING clause is used with a multiple row function.
The HAVING clause is applied after the GROUP BY clause, but the WHERE clause is applied before the GROUP BY clause.
You can use the WHERE clause without the GROUP BY clause, But you cannot use the HAVING clause without the GROUP BY clause.
You can use the WHERE clause with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Whereas you can use the HAVING clause only with the SELECT statement.
The WHERE clause in SQL allows you to filter data from specific rows (individual rows) from a table based on certain conditions. In contrast, the HAVING clause in 
SQL allows you to filter data from a group of rows in a query based on conditions involving aggregate values.
