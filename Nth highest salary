as we disscuss in 2 highest salary question 
halndeling all the cases 
we should use
Set N=N-1;
SELECT IFNULL((select distinct salary from employee orber by salary desc limit 1 OFFSET N),NULL) as NthhighestSalary


proper way :

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
SET N=N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
    select IFNULL((select Distinct salary from Employee order by salary desc limit 1 OFFSET N) ,NULL) as getNthHighestSalary
  );
END
