mast solution :
1.handeling the duplicate salary
2.handeling the one employee record
3.it can be used as nTH highest salary record.
select IFNULL((DISTINCT(e_salary) from employee order by e_salary desc limit 1 OFFSET 1) NULL) as secondhighestsalary ;
bas offset ko change skarna hoga hisab se , 2 highest chahiye to offset 1 , 3 highest chahiye to offset 2 ....
nth highest k liye N-1 offset chahiye

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

//for view the second salary--
select e_salary from employee order by e_salary desc;

1.solution with sub query
select max(e_salary) as second_highest_salary from employee where e_salary
<(select max(e_salary) from employee);

2. solution : desc order by kar 2 wala highest hoga es liye limit 1 aur offset 1 kar de
select e_salary from employee order by e_salary desc limit 1 OFFSET 1;   
but esme dikkat ye hai ye agar salary same huwa to usse nahi handel kar payega es liye ham distict function ka use karenge

-->> select DISTINCT(e_salary) as secondhighestsalary from employee order by e_salary desc limit 1 OFFSET 1;

3..upeer wala sulution ek case handel nahi kar raha hai jab ek hi employee ho to we need to give null as a secondhighest salary
solution ::
select IFNULL((DISTINCT(e_salary) from employee order by e_salary desc limit 1 OFFSET 1) NULL) as secondhighestsalary ;

ab agar 3 highest chahiye to offset 2 rakh do....>>>>

5 th highest chahiye to offset 4 rakh doo
